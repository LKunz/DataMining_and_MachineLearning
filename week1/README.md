# Colab and Python Notebooks
- Introduction of Teaching Assistants.
- Link to the Moodle page of the course: https://moodle.unil.ch/course/view.php?id=17164
- Everyone joins class Slack channel. We will use Slack for all communication in the class.
- Brief intro how to use slack.
  - Exercise (everyone): Post a message under `#general` introducing yourself, where you are from and a fun fact about you.
- Breif explanation of Assignment 0. You can find the full description of the assignment here. Note that this is an ungraded but __mandatory__ assignment. To get an idea about this assignment, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkX6whEGN1Y) from one of the last year's submissions
## What we will cover in the lab

- What are Python notebooks? 
    - They are a complete narrative of code and comments that can render many HTML components, such as images, hyperlinks, videos, etc. Therefore, the goal of a notebook is to demonstrate some code or explain some idea in the most engaging way possible.
- What is [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb)? (click on the link to review)
    - It is a Python notebook that runs on the cloud so you don't need to install anything on your PC. It runs on the browser.
    - Difference between Code and Text/Markdown: A Python notebook contains two types of cells. Today we will deal with the text/markdown part.
- Shortcuts for entering code and markdown mode in Colab.
    - Convert cell to code cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M Y`
    - Convert cell to text/markdown cell:	`Ctrl/Cmd M M`
- Introduction to [markdown](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)
    - Headings, bullets, hyperlinks, bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, etc
    - Tables
    - Latex equations in markdown
    - Review [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for markdown features or the shorter [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Images, videos
    - Go [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week1%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/Notebooks_Introduction.ipynb) and review this notebook to see various features and also how to embed images and videos.
- How to [load](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) in Colab an ipynb from Github
- Autocomplete in Google Colab for code [optional]
    - When you write Python code in Colab it helps you "autocomplete" the code. Check out [this noteboook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb#scrollTo=d4L9TOP9QSHn)
- You may need to export a colab notebook as `.ipynb` file and save it to you computer (for instance when you want to submit your assignments in moodle). To do so just go to __File -> Download .ipynb__.
    
## Python
Python will be the main programming language we will be using throughout this course. If you feel like you need to review some basics about Python, You can follow this [Python course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) from kaggle.


## Exercises

After you have become familiar with Colab you can do the following exercises:



1. **Exercise 1:** Recreate [this](https://github.com/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week1%20-%20Python%20Notebooks/Exercise1.png) in Colab. This may require some knowledge of Latex for recreating the equations, so if you are not very familiar with this just ask your TAs.
